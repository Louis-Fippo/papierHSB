\caption{Percentage of acceptance of the 12 traces. The first column represents the Automata $\mathcal{A}_{i}(w)$, where $\mathcal{A}_{i}$ is the Automata and $w$ is the word recongnised by $\mathcal{A}_{i}$ 
(which corresponds to the experimental measures) that is used to check if a given trace is accepted for a component in the second 
column. One can observe that many components can be recongnised by the same Automata. 
In the third column we have the percentage of acceptance for each trace.}
