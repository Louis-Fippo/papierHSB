In this work we propose an automatic way of generating and verifying formal hybrid models of signaling and transcriptional
events, gathered in large-scale regulatory networks.This is done  by integrating temporal and stochastic aspects of 
the expression of some biological components. The hybrid approach lies in the fact that measurements take into account both times of lenthening phases and discrete switches between them. The model proposed is based on a real case study of keratinocyte differentiation, in which gene time-series data was generated upon Calcium stimulation.

To achieve this we rely on the Process Hitting (PH) formalism that was design in order to take very large system analysis into account.  We first propose an automatic way of detecting and translate biological motif from PID to the PH formalism. Then, we propose a way of estimating temporal and stochastic parameters from time-series expression data of action on the PH. Simulations emphase the interest of synchronizing concurrent events.
